### What I learned

It seemed like a very simple project, although i wondered how i would create the arrow bellow the share pop up, but the idea came when i got there. I spent some time trying to change the color of the svg image but i had no issue with the js togglings, yeah surprisingly. It was a FUN challenge. I learned a lot, i didnt know i had it all in me.
